# HOF Cognitive Model Training on Hugging Face

This document demonstrates the training of a HOF cognitive model on Hugging Face, including HOF cognitive agent chaining with a fine-tuned model.

## Installation

First, install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

### Step 1: Fine-tuning a Small Model

Run the fine-tuning script:

```bash
python -m hof_cognitive_model_training.fine_tuning
```

### Step 2: Upload to Hugging Face

Run the upload script:

```bash
python -m hof_cognitive_model_training.upload_model --token YOUR_HUGGINGFACE_TOKEN
```

Replace `YOUR_HUGGINGFACE_TOKEN` with your actual Hugging Face token.

### Step 3: Implement HOF Cognitive Chaining

Run the cognitive chaining script:

```bash
python -m hof_cognitive_model_training.cognitive_chaining --username YOUR_USERNAME
```

Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` with your actual Hugging Face username.

## Summary

1. **Fine-tune a small model**: Using Hugging Face’s Trainer API.
2. **Upload the model**: To Hugging Face’s Model Hub.
3. **Set up HOF Cognitive Agents**: Using the fine-tuned model.
4. **Implement chaining**: Based on the Functionally Atomic Development Paradigm and other provided documents.

For complete implementation details, refer to the specific requirements and configurations from the provided documents.
